# Netflix-Clone

Starter project used to polish React and frontend skills (including using Material UI icons, using Sass, and incorporating React hooks). Took inspiration from online resources/similar kinds of clones. Worked on during summer 2023.

Aiming to eventually build out into a full stack application using Node.js
